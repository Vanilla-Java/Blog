= Why double Still Outperforms BigDecimal: A Decade-Long Performance Comparison
:source-highlighter: rouge

== Overview

Many developers consider `BigDecimal` the go-to solution for handling money in Java. They often claim that replacing `double` with `BigDecimal` has fixed one or more bugs in their applications. However, I find this reasoning unconvincing. The issue may lie not with `double` but rather with how it was handled. Additionally, `BigDecimal` introduces significant overhead that may not justify its use.

When asked to improve the performance of a financial application, I know that if `BigDecimal` is involved, it will eventually need to be removed. While it may not be the largest performance bottleneck initially, as we optimise the system, `BigDecimal` often becomes one of the main culprits.

== BigDecimal is Not an Improvement

`BigDecimal` comes with several drawbacks. Here are some of its key issues:

* It has an unnatural syntax. The API is verbose and can be cumbersome to use.
* It uses more memory. `BigDecimal` objects consume more memory compared to primitive types.
* It creates more garbage (i.e., it causes more frequent garbage collection).
* It is significantly slower for most operations, although there are exceptions.

The following JMH benchmark demonstrates two of the most prominent issues with `BigDecimal`: clarity and performance.

== Code Comparison

The core task is to take an average of two values. Here's how it looks when using `double`:

[source,java]
----
mp[i] = round6((ap[i] + bp[i]) / 2);
----

Notice the need for rounding. Now, the same operation using `BigDecimal` requires much more verbose code:

[source,java]
----
mp2[i] = ap2[i].add(bp2[i])
     .divide(BigDecimal.valueOf(2), 6, BigDecimal.ROUND_HALF_UP);
----

Does this give you different results? For the most part, `double` provides 15 digits of precision, which is more than enough for typical monetary values. If these prices had 17 digits, `BigDecimal` might be more appropriate. However, the complexity it adds to the code is unnecessary for most practical use cases—it’s a poor trade-off for the developer who has to maintain and comprehend the code.

== Performance

If you have to incur coding overhead, it’s usually done for performance reasons. However, using `BigDecimal` for simple arithmetic does not make sense in this case.

The following JMH benchmark results show a significant performance difference between `BigDecimal` and `double`:

----

As you can see, the `double` implementation outperforms the `BigDecimal` implementation by a factor of more than five. Note: using `double` made more difference than ten years of processor and JVM improvements.

*NOTE*: Rounding makes a big difference (a factor of ten) for `double` as it involves a division.

== Conclusion

If you’re unsure about how to properly handle rounding with `double`, or if your project mandates the use of `BigDecimal`, then by all means, use `BigDecimal`. However, if you have a choice, don’t just assume that `BigDecimal` is the right way to go. The additional complexity and performance overhead may not be worth it in many cases.

== Key Points

* `BigDecimal` introduces significant overhead in terms of memory and performance.
* For most monetary calculations, `double` offers sufficient precision and better performance.
* Code using `BigDecimal` tends to be more verbose and harder to maintain.
* Performance benchmarks consistently show `double` outperforming `BigDecimal` by a substantial margin.
* Consider the trade-offs between precision, performance, and code complexity when choosing between `double` and `BigDecimal`.
