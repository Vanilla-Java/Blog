= Calculating an Average Without Overflow: Rounding Methods

Calculating the midpoint between two integers may seem trivial, but the naive approach can lead to overflow errors.
Code sample MidpointCalculator is available here: https://github.com/Vanilla-Java/Blog/blob/main/core-concepts/src/main/java/blog/vanillajava/MidpointCalculator.java[Code sample MidpointCalculator].

The classic midpoint formula:

[source,java]
----
int m = (h + l) / 2;
----

is prone to overflow if `h` and `l` are large, causing the result to be incorrect. This bug appears in many algorithms, including binary search implementations.

== Understanding the Problem of Overflow

In Java, the `int` type has a fixed range from `-2,147,483,648` to `2,147,483,647`. If `h` and `l` are large, their sum might exceed this range, leading to overflow. When overflow occurs, Java wraps the result around to the negative range without warning, causing unpredictable results.

== Safer Approaches to Calculate a Midpoint

1. *Using a Safer Formula*

A well-known alternative to avoid overflow is:

[source,java]
----
int m = l + (h - l) / 2;
----

Here, we compute the difference `(h - l)` before dividing by 2, ensuring that we don’t add two large values directly. This is safe but somewhat cumbersome.

2. *Using Unsigned Right Shift (with Down-Rounding)*

My preferred approach is to use the unsigned right shift operator `>>>`, which divides by two while avoiding overflow:

[source,java]
----
int m = (h + l) >>> 1;
----

In this approach, we add `h` and `l` and then perform an unsigned right shift by one. This method provides a simple and efficient midpoint calculation that avoids overflow. However, it always rounds down when dividing, which may not always be desirable.

3. *Using Unsigned Right Shift (with Half-Up Rounding)*

An alternative approach is to use the unsigned right shift operator `>>>`, which divides by two plus one while avoiding overflow:

[source,java]
----
int m = (h + l + 1) >>> 1;
----

In this approach, we add `h` and `l` and then perform an unsigned right shift by one. This method provides a simple and efficient midpoint calculation that avoids overflow while rounding half-up if needed.

== Example: Comparing Rounding Methods

Let’s look at an example to see the difference between rounding down and rounding half-up. Suppose `h` and `l` are `byte` values with `h = 102` and `l = 99`:

* *Using Rounding Down*

[source,java]
----
int m = (h + l) >>> 1;
----

- `h + l` is `201`.
- Unsigned shifting `201` by one bit gives `100`, rounding down.

* *Using Rounding Half-Up*

[source,java]
----
int m = (h + l + 1) >>> 1;
----

- `h + l + 1` is `202`.
- Unsigned shifting `202` by one bit gives `101`, rounding half-up.

This rounding behaviour can be particularly useful in cases where you're dividing odd sums and want to follow standard rounding conventions.

== Practical Applications of Rounding Choices

Using `(h + l) >>> 1` is ideal when you want the midpoint calculation to round down, which is often preferred in low-level programming and binary search algorithms. On the other hand, if you need rounding to the nearest integer in scenarios where the halfway point should round up (known as *round half-up*), using `(h + l + 1) >>> 1` gives you that flexibility.

== Summary

When calculating a safe midpoint between two integers, avoid using `(h + l) / 2` as it risks overflow. Instead:

* Use `(h + l) >>> 1` for a midpoint that rounds down.
* Use `(h + l + 1) >>> 1` for a midpoint that rounds half-up, rounding up in cases where the sum is odd.

These options allow you to control rounding behaviour precisely and avoid subtle bugs that might emerge in large data handling, ensuring safer, more predictable algorithms.
