= Overly Long Class Names in Java or Geeky Poem?
Peter Lawrey, CEO of Chronicle Software

In Java development, clear and concise naming conventions are essential for code readability and maintainability.
However, sometimes, we encounter class names that stretch the limits of practicality.
One such example is `InternalFrameTitlePaneMaximizeButtonWindowNotFocusedState`.
But did you know that in Java 6, this class name was even longer?

Within the Java 6 JRE, there's a class with an astonishingly lengthy name:

----
com.sun.java.swing.plaf.nimbus.InternalFrameInternalFrameTitlePaneInternalFrameTitlePaneMaximizeButtonWindowNotFocusedState
----

This mouthful appears to be the product of a code generator that needed reviewing, leading to redundant and cumbersome naming.
Or is it a geeky poem buried in the code?

[source]
----
InternalFrame InternalFrame
Title Pane,
Internal Frame
Title Pane.

Maximise Button Window,
Not Focused State.
----

The moral of the story is: always check the readability and sanity of generated code.
