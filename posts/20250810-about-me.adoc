= Peter Lawrey

*Peter Lawrey* is a British software engineer and entrepreneur best known for work on ultra-low-latency Java systems and for leading the open-source _OpenHFT_ libraries.
He is the founder and chief executive of Chronicle Software, a London-based company whose technology is used in trading and market-infrastructure workloads.
Lawrey is also a recognised Java community figure: he was named a Java Champion in 2015, has been described by conference organisers as having provided the most answers for the Java and JVM tags on Stack Overflow, and writes the long-running _Vanilla Java_ blog.

== Career

Lawrey founded and leads Chronicle Software, which builds enabling technology for event-driven trading and market-data platforms.
The company states that its software underpins systems at several tier-one banks; a 2024 press announcement similarly described Chronicle as supplying "8 of the top 11 investment banks".

Alongside the commercial platform, Lawrey architects and stewards Chronicle's open-source projects under the _OpenHFT_ umbrella.
These include _Chronicle Queue_ (a persisted low-latency shared memory messaging framework) and _Chronicle Map_ (a high-performance in-memory/off-heap key-value store).
The projects are widely used in low-latency and high-throughput applications.

Lawrey regularly presents at software-engineering conferences (including QCon, JCrete) on topics such as microservices for performance, vertical scalability and practical techniques for achieving deterministic latency on the JVM.
InfoQ and other outlets have covered his talks and interviews.

== Personal life

Lawrey lives in Surrey, United Kingdom, has six children.
He has expressed a long-standing interest in the works of H. G. Wells-particularly "The War of the Worlds" and lives near Horsell Common, a location featured in the novel.
Among his favourite quotations are "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away," attributed to Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, and "The book to read is not the one that thinks for you but the one which makes you think," commonly attributed to Harper Lee. Both these quotes apply to the age of Generative AI as well.
