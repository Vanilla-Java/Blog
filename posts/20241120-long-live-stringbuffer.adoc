= StringBuffer is Dead, Long Live StringBuffer
Peter Lawrey, CEO of Chronicle Software

When Java 5.0 was released on 30^th^ September 2004, it introduced `StringBuilder` as a replacement for `StringBuffer` in cases where thread safety isn't required.
The idea was simple: if you're manipulating strings within a single thread, `StringBuilder` offers a faster, unsynchronized alternative to `StringBuffer`.

This is an updated https://blog.vanillajava.blog/2011/05/stringbuffer-is-dead-long-live.html[article from 2011].

== From the Javadoc for `StringBuilder`

[quote]
____
This class provides an API compatible with `StringBuffer`, but with no guarantee of synchronization.
This class is designed for use as a drop-in replacement for `StringBuffer` in places where the string buffer was being used by a single thread (as is generally the case).
Where possible, it is recommended that this class be used in preference to `StringBuffer` as it will be faster under most implementations.

== Is `StringBuffer` Really Dead?

You might think that `StringBuffer` has become redundant, given that most single-threaded scenarios can use `StringBuilder`, and thread safety often requires explicit synchronization beyond what `StringBuffer` provides.
Yet, if we look at the latest OpenJDK (Java 21), it appears that `StringBuffer` is still very much alive.

Consider the usage statistics in OpenJDK Java 21 compared to Java 6 Update 25:

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Class | Uses in Java 21.0.5 | Uses in Java 6u25

| `StringBuffer`
| 601
| 1,409

| `StringBuilder`
| 3,262
| 311
|===

While `StringBuilder` usage has significantly increased, `StringBuffer` still has a substantial presence.
This raises the question: why hasn't `StringBuffer` been phased out in favor of its unsynchronized counterpart, especially in the JDK's own codebase?

== Why is `StringBuffer` Only Kind of Thread-Safe

For `StringBuffer`, individual methods are thread-safe; however, you usually need to make more than one call, and you can get multiple outcomes.

Consider the following scenario involving three threads in Java:

* Thread 1 executes: `stringBuffer.append("1").append("2");`
* Thread 2 executes: `stringBuffer.append("A").append("B");`
* Thread 3 executes: `System.out.println(stringBuffer);`

=== Question
What are all the possible outputs that could be printed by the `System.out.println` statement in Thread 3?

Keep in mind that `StringBuffer` is thread-safe and its methods are synchronized.
The order of operations within each thread is fixed, but the execution order across threads can vary.

*Answer:*

The possible outputs that might be printed are:

* `""` (empty string)
* `"1"`
* `"1A"`
* `"1AB"`
* `"1A2"`
* `"1A2B"`
* `"1AB2"`
* `"12"`
* `"12A"`
* `"12AB"`
* `"A"`
* `"A1"`
* `"A1B"`
* `"A1B2"`
* `"A12"`
* `"A12B"`
* `"AB"`
* `"AB1"`
* `"AB12"`

== Why Does `StringBuffer` Persist?

Migration is hard.
Much harder than you might expect.
Especially when you have a codebase that works.
Oracle can't force developers to migrate their code, but one might expect that the JDK's internal code would adopt `StringBuilder` where appropriate.
Yet, even after nearly two decades, `StringBuffer` remains in use in places where thread safety isn't a concern.

Let's look at some examples from Java 21 where `StringBuffer` is used as a local variable in methods that are not thread-safe:

* `javax.swing.text.html.StyleSheet#getRule`
* `javax.swing.text.html.parser.Parser#parseTag`
* `jdk.internal.icu.text.BidiWriter#doWriteForward`
* `jdk.internal.org.jline.reader.PrintAboveWriter#flush`
* `sun.jvm.hotspot.oops.Method#externalNameAndSignature`
* `sun.security.mscapi.CPublicKey.CECPublicKey#toString`

Interestingly, some methods even mix `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer`:

* `sun.jvm.hotspot.interpreter.BytecodeGetPut#toString`

And in an ironic twist, non-thread-safe classes like `SimpleDateFormat` and other `Format` classes use `StringBuffer` internally.

== Performance Implications

Using `StringBuffer` when thread safety isn't needed introduces unnecessary overhead due to its synchronized methods.
To illustrate the performance difference, consider the following benchmark:

[source,java]
----
public static void main(String... args) {
    String text = "A short piece of text for copying";
    int runs = 1_000_000;

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        {
            long start = System.nanoTime();
            StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(text);
            for (int r = 0; r < runs; r++)
                copyStringBuffer(sb);
            long time = System.nanoTime() - start;
            System.out.printf("StringBuffer took an average of %,d ns%n", time / runs);
        }
        {
            long start = System.nanoTime();
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(text);
            for (int r = 0; r < runs; r++)
                copyStringBuilder(sb);
            long time = System.nanoTime() - start;
            System.out.printf("StringBuilder took an average of %,d ns%n", time / runs);
        }
    }
}

public static String copyStringBuffer(StringBuffer text) {
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
    for (int i = 0; i < text.length(); i++)
        sb.append(text.charAt(i));
    return sb.toString();
}

public static String copyStringBuilder(StringBuilder text) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 0; i < text.length(); i++)
        sb.append(text.charAt(i));
    return sb.toString();
}
----

Running this benchmark on a Ryzen 5950X with Ubuntu and Azul JDK 21.0.5 yields:

[source]
----
StringBuffer took an average of 456 ns
StringBuilder took an average of 125 ns
StringBuffer took an average of 461 ns
StringBuilder took an average of 162 ns
StringBuffer took an average of 400 ns
StringBuilder took an average of 97 ns
StringBuffer took an average of 387 ns
StringBuilder took an average of 98 ns
StringBuffer took an average of 388 ns
StringBuilder took an average of 97 ns
----

The results show that `StringBuffer` is approximately four times slower than `StringBuilder` in this scenario.
While the absolute difference in nanoseconds might seem trivial, in performance-critical applications or loops, this overhead can accumulate.

== Why Doesn't Escape Analysis Help?

One might hope that the JVM's Escape Analysis could optimize away the synchronization overhead of `StringBuffer` when used locally.
However, the JVM doesn't eliminate this overhead in such cases.

== Conclusion

Despite the introduction of `StringBuilder` nearly two decades ago, `StringBuffer` persists in both third-party and JDK internal code.
This suggests that relying on passive adoption of improvements isn't sufficient.
A deliberate effort is needed to refactor existing codebases.

For developers, it's crucial to:
* *Audit your code*: Identify where `StringBuffer` is used and assess if `StringBuilder` can replace it.
* *Understand your thread model*: Ensure that you're not inadvertently introducing thread safety issues when switching to `StringBuilder`.
* *Benchmark critical sections*: Measure the performance impact of such changes in your specific context.

== Key Takeaways

* `StringBuilder` offers a faster alternative to `StringBuffer` for single-threaded scenarios.
* Even in the latest JDK, `StringBuffer` remains widely used, often unnecessarily.
* Developers should actively refactor code to replace `StringBuffer` with `StringBuilder` where appropriate.
* Performance gains from such refactoring can be significant, especially in tight loops or performance-critical code.
