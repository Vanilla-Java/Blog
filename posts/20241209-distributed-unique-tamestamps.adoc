= Producing Distributed Unique Timestamp Identifiers

/// Consider adding an image diagram illustrating multiple hosts generating IDs.

[role="info"]
Distributed unique timestamp identifiers, generated in sub-microsecond time, enable systems to assign globally unique, human-readable 64-bit values at extremely high throughput. This approach helps align event ordering across hosts and simplifies debugging in complex, time-sensitive, and latency-critical environments.

== Introduction

In a world of horizontally scaled microservices, ensuring that each event or message receives a unique identifier across multiple machines can be challenging. Traditional approaches often rely on UUIDs, which—while easy to use—lack intuitive readability and can be relatively expensive to generate in ultra-low-latency scenarios.

Our solution builds upon nanosecond-resolution timestamps combined with a host identifier embedded directly into the lower-order digits of the timestamp. This technique, inspired by previous work on system-wide unique nanosecond timestamps, creates identifiers that are compact, human-interpretable, and extremely fast to produce. In essence, we treat time itself as the source of uniqueness.

By carefully structuring the timestamp and assigning a unique *hostId* per machine (or per logical partition), we can scale to produce up to one billion unique 64-bit identifiers per second. These identifiers repeat only after centuries, making them suitable for long-running systems and distributed architectures that demand both precision and high performance.

== Concurrent identifier generation in a distributed system

In distributed environments, colliding identifiers can lead to data corruption, misrouted requests, or difficulty in debugging. Although UUIDs solve uniqueness issues, they do not inherently convey temporal ordering or machine origin. More subtle forms of identifiers, such as database sequence numbers or custom counters, often need to be more convenient when synchronising across multiple hosts.

Our approach sets out to solve these issues by:

- Guaranteeing uniqueness across multiple hosts without complex coordination.
- Embedding a host identifier directly into the timestamp.
- Preserving direct human readability and chronological ordering.
- Operating efficiently under heavy concurrency with minimal contention.

== Designing a Distributed Time-Based Identifier

The core concept is straightforward: take the current time with nanosecond precision and modify its least significant digits to represent a *hostId*. For example, if you have 100 hosts, you can reserve the last two digits of the timestamp to encode the *hostId* values from 00 to 99. Each machine thus derives a unique identifier from the combination of its *hostId* and the current time.

[source,java]
----
DistributedUniqueTimeProvider timeProvider = DistributedUniqueTimeProvider.forHostId(28);
long uniqueId = timeProvider.currentTimeNanos();
System.out.println("Distributed Unique ID: " + uniqueId);
----

== A nano-second timestamp with a host identifier

`DistributedUniqueTimeProvider` stores a host identifier in the lower two digits of the timestamp, making it easier to read. The previous implementation used bit shifting so the `hostId` could be obtained, but that was difficult for a human to read.

This allows you to produce guaranteed unique identifiers, encoded with up to 100 sources across up to 100 machines, with multiple JVMs on the same machine sharing a `hostId`.

The timestamp looks like this on a machine with a `hostId` of 28:

`2021-12-28T14:07:02.9541001**28**`

Where the date/time/microseconds are the time, and the last two digits are the host identifier, making it easier to see the source in the timestamp. Human operators can quickly see when and where the identifier was produced. This clarity facilitates debugging and operational insight without sacrificing uniqueness or performance.

The resolution is approximately one-tenth of a microsecond (100 nanoseconds), which often matches or exceeds the practical resolution of the underlying clock hardware. This approach, therefore, leverages the natural granularity of the system clock without adding artificial delays.

== Configuring the Host Identifier

You can assign a *hostId* either through the command line system property:

`-DhostId=xx`

or programmatically by calling:

`DistributedUniqueTimeProvider.INSTANCE.hostId(hostId);`

== Speeding up the assignment with a host identifier

Having a preconfigured host identifier and keeping track of the most recent identifier in shared memory allows fast concurrent generation of identifiers across machines.

Up to the theoretical limit of one billion per second.

The happy path is simple: take the current time, remove the lower two digits and add the hostId. As long as this is higher than the last identifier, it’s okay. Should the machine fail and the information as to the last identifier be lost, the assumption is that the time taken to restart the service is enough time to ensure there is no overlap. If the service fails, but not the machine, the information is retained.

%% Define subgraph for Host 1
subgraph "Host 1"
    direction LR
    host1_id("hostId = 01")
    current_time1("currentTimeNanos()")
    unique_id1("Unique ID<br>e.g. ...101")

    host1_id --> current_time1
    current_time1 --> unique_id1
end

%% Define subgraph for Host 0

    direction LR
    host0_id("hostId = 00")
    current_time0("currentTimeNanos()")
    unique_id0("Unique ID<br>e.g. ...100")

    host0_id --> current_time0
    current_time0 --> unique_id0
end

%% Define the Mapped Files
mapped_file1[("Mapped File 1<br> hostId = 01<br> ...<br> LAST_TIME")]
mapped_file0[("Mapped File 0<br> hostId = 00<br> ...<br> LAST_TIME")]

---------------------------------------------------------------------

This diagram shows two separate hosts, each maintaining its memory-mapped file. Every time a host generates a new timestamp-based identifier, it updates the stored 'LAST_TIME' in its file using atomic operations. This ensures that the host will not generate a duplicate identifier even after a restart, preserving uniqueness across the entire distributed system.

NOTE: This uses the `MappedFile` in shared memory supported by https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Bytes[Chronicle Bytes], an open-source library.

[source,java]
----
@Override
public long currentTimeNanos() {
    long time = provider.currentTimeNanos();
    long lastTime = bytes.readVolatileLong(LAST_TIME);
    long next = time - time % HOST_IDS + hostId;

    if (next > lastTime && bytes.compareAndSwapLong(LAST_TIME, lastTime, next)) {
        return next;
    }
    return currentTimeNanosLoop();
}
----

If the time hasn’t progressed, either due to high contention or the wall clock going backwards (e.g. due to a correction), a loop is called to find the next available identifier.

[source,java]
----
private long currentTimeNanosLoop() {
    while (true) {
        long time0 = bytes.readVolatileLong(LAST_TIME);
        long next = time0 - time0 % HOST_IDS + hostId;
        if (next <= time0) {
            next += HOST_IDS;
        }
        if (bytes.compareAndSwapLong(LAST_TIME, time0, next)) {
            return next;
        }
        Jvm.nanoPause(); // Introduces a tiny pause to reduce contention spinning.
    }
}
----


This loop looks for the next possible timestamp (with the hostId) and attempts to update it.

== Using JMH to benchmark the timestamp provider

With JMH, benchmarking this utility in a single-threaded manner is pretty easy.

[source,java]
----
@State(Scope.Benchmark)
public class DistributedUniqueTimeProviderBenchmark {
    private DistributedUniqueTimeProvider timeProvider;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws RunnerException {
        Options opt = new OptionsBuilder()
                .include(DistributedUniqueTimeProviderBenchmark.class.getSimpleName())
                .warmupIterations(3)
                .measurementIterations(5)
                .measurementTime(TimeValue.seconds(5))
                .forks(5)
                .build();

        new Runner(opt).run();
    }

    @Setup
    public void setUp() {
        timeProvider = DistributedUniqueTimeProvider.forHostId(1);
    }

    @TearDown
    public void tearDown() {
        timeProvider.close();
    }

    @Benchmark
    @BenchmarkMode(Mode.AverageTime)
    @OutputTimeUnit(TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS)
    public long currentTimeNanos() {
        return timeProvider.currentTimeNanos();
    }
}
----

After less than five minutes, we get the following result on my Windows laptop. You can get better results on a high-end server or desktop. The average time is around 37.4 nanoseconds. While this is single-threaded, this is generally on the unhappy path, as timestamps need to be at least 100 ns apart or they temporarily run ahead of the wall clock.

*UUID.randomUUID()* is also very fast, only about six times longer. However, if you need a timestamp and a source identifier for your event anyway, this avoids additional work or data.

Benchmarking with JMH in a single-threaded context showed that obtaining a unique timestamp takes approximately 37.4 nanoseconds on average. In comparison, `UUID.randomUUID()` is about six times slower. On an i9-10980HK processor, the benchmark results were:

[options="header"]
|===
| Benchmark                                             | Mode | Count | Score   | Error  | Units |
| DistributedUniqueTimeProviderBenchmark.currentTimeNanos | avgt | 25    | 37.395  | ±0.391 | ns/op |
| DistributedUniqueTimeProviderBenchmark.randomUUID       | avgt | 25    | 207.709 | ±1.586 | ns/op |

On a Ryzen 9 5950X processor, the results were:

[options="header"]

| Benchmark                                             | Mode | Count | Score   | Error  | Units |
| DistributedUniqueTimeProviderBenchmark.currentTimeNanos | avgt | 25    | 43.557  | ±0.801 | ns/op |
| DistributedUniqueTimeProviderBenchmark.randomUUID       | avgt | 25    | 265.285 | ±2.690 | ns/op |

== Downsides

There are some advantages to using UUIDs:

* It’s built-in and the extra overhead might not be a concern.
* No configuration is required.
* They are not predictable, while the timestamp-based ones are highly predictable.

== Try It Yourself

Consider integrating the *DistributedUniqueTimeProvider* into a logging framework or event pipeline. By injecting host-based timestamps, you can more easily correlate events across multiple machines in real time:

- Run a local benchmark with JMH to measure performance on your hardware.
- Experiment with different *hostId* allocations to confirm uniqueness and ordering.
- Integrate into a distributed queue or event-processing system to verify end-to-end latency improvements.

== Conclusion

If you can use some predetermined partitioning by host identifier, you can have an 8-byte lightweight identifier that is unique across many hosts. The identifier is still easily readable as text in a slightly modified form of a timestamp.

By embedding host identifiers into nanosecond-level timestamps, developers gain a simple and effective mechanism for generating globally unique, chronologically sortable identifiers. This efficient and intuitive approach makes it particularly suitable for high-performance distributed systems.

== Key Takeaways

- **Guaranteed uniqueness** across distributed hosts by embedding a *hostId* into timestamps.
- **Readable identifiers** enabling quick debugging and event correlation.
- **High performance** with minimal overhead, measurable in tens of nanoseconds.
- **Ease of use**, achievable with a few lines of code and minimal configuration.
