= Thread Safety Issues with Vector and Hashtable

== Introduction

Despite being considered legacy since Java 1.2 (1998), `Vector` and `Hashtable` remain prevalent in many Java applications. A common belief is that their synchronised methods render them inherently thread-safe. However, this assumption can lead to subtle concurrency problems that are often overlooked.

Have you encountered unexpected exceptions when iterating over a `Vector` in a multi-threaded environment? Let's delve into why this happens and how to address it.

== The Misconception of Thread Safety

Both `Vector` and `Hashtable` synchronise individual method calls, leading many developers to assume that these classes are safe to use concurrently without additional synchronisation. While each method is thread-safe, combining multiple method calls can introduce race conditions if not properly managed.

== Are Iterators Thread-Safe?

The' Iterator' is not thread-safe for most collections, including `Vector`. Iterators are designed to fail fast by throwing a `ConcurrentModificationException` when they detect concurrent modifications. However, this detection is not guaranteed, as the modification counter is not marked as `volatile`. This means that changes made in one thread might not be immediately visible to the iterator in another thread.

Here's a summary of iterator behaviours across different collections:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Collection | Iterator Behaviour

| `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `TreeSet`
| Typically throw a `ConcurrentModificationException` when modified concurrently.

| `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, `CopyOnWriteArraySet`
| Provide a consistent snapshot of the collection at the time of iterator creation.

| `ArrayBlockingQueue`, `LinkedBlockingQueue`
| Iterators are weakly consistent and do not throw exceptions on concurrent modifications.

| `PriorityQueue`
| Iterators are weakly consistent; the collection is sorted, but the iterator may not reflect the current sorted state.
|===

== Is Enumeration Thread-Safe?

`Vector` provides an `Enumeration` via the `elements()` method. Each method of `Enumeration`, such as `hasMoreElements()` and `nextElement()`, is synchronised. At first glance, this might suggest that iterating over a `Vector` using `Enumeration` is thread-safe. However, the reality is more nuanced.

Consider the following code snippet:

[source, java]
----
Vector<Integer> ints = new Vector<>();
ints.add(1);
ints.add(2);
Enumeration<Integer> en = ints.elements();
int count = 0;
while (en.hasMoreElements()) {
    // Simulate another thread modifying the collection.
    if (count++ == 1) ints.remove(0);
    System.out.println(en.nextElement());
}
----

In this example, after the first iteration, the call to `ints.remove(0);` modifies the `Vector`. Because `hasMoreElements()` and `nextElement()` are separate synchronised methods, another thread can alter the collection between these calls. This can lead to a `NoSuchElementException` when `nextElement()` is called, as the expected element may no longer be present.

From personal experience, such issues can be particularly challenging to debug, especially in systems where the concurrency problem manifests intermittently.

=== Making Enumeration Thread-Safe

To ensure thread safety during iteration, you need to lock the collection for the entire duration of the enumeration. This prevents other threads from modifying the collection while it's being iterated. Here's how you can modify the previous example:

[source, java]
----
Vector<Integer> ints = new Vector<>();
ints.add(1);
ints.add(2);
synchronized (ints) {
    Enumeration<Integer> en = ints.elements();
    while (en.hasMoreElements()) {
        // Other threads cannot modify 'ints' while it's locked.
        System.out.println(en.nextElement());
    }
}
----

By synchronising on the `Vector` itself, we ensure that no other thread can enter any synchronised methods on the same object until the block is exited. This approach effectively serialises access to the collection during iteration.

However, this solution comes with a performance trade-off. Locking the collection for the duration of the iteration can lead to contention in multi-threaded applications, potentially impacting scalability. It's essential to balance thread safety with performance considerations.

== Alternatives to Vector and Hashtable

Modern Java provides several concurrent collection classes in the `java.util.concurrent` package designed for high concurrency and thread safety. For instance, `ConcurrentHashMap` and `CopyOnWriteArrayList` perform better in multi-threaded environments without external synchronisation during iteration.

== Conclusion

Synchronisation at the method level does not guarantee thread safety when combined methods are used. When working with collections like `Vector` and `Hashtable`, it's crucial to understand that thread safety requires careful coordination of multiple method calls. Locking the collection during iteration is one way to prevent concurrent modifications and ensure consistent behaviour, but it may not be the most efficient solution.

Consider reviewing your codebase: Are there places where you rely on `Vector` or `Hashtable` for thread safety? It might be time to refactor these parts using modern concurrent collections that provide better performance and scalability.

== Key Takeaways

- Do not assume `synchronized` methods make a class thread-safe in all contexts.
- Iterators and enumerations may not be thread-safe when used across multiple methods.
- Synchronise the collection during iteration to prevent concurrent modifications.
- Be mindful of the performance implications of locking collections.
- Consider using concurrent collection classes designed for multi-threaded environments.
