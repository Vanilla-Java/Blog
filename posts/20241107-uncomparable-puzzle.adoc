= Incomparable Puzzles in Java
:source-highlighter: rouge

Here are a few puzzles for you to solve in Java. The source is available here: https://github.com/Vanilla-Java/Blog/blob/main/java-misconceptions/src/main/java/blog/vanillajava/UncomparablePuzzles.java[UncomparablePuzzles.java].

== Puzzle 1: Comparing `long` and `double`

Try running the following code to reproduce the output below. See if you can work out why these results occur:

[source,java]
----
long a = (1L << 54) + 1;
double b = a;
System.out.println("b == a is " + (b == a));
System.out.println("(long) b < a is " + ((long) b < a));
----

When executed, it produces:

[source]
----
b == a is true
(long) b < a is true
----

=== Analysis

This puzzle highlights the precision limitations when converting between `long` and `double`.

1. **Precision Loss During Conversion**
The `long` value `a` is `(1L << 54) + 1`, which is `18014398509481985`. When cast to `double`, `b` becomes `18014398509481984.0`. Due to `double` 's 53-bit mantissa, it cannot accurately represent every `long` value beyond this range, resulting in precision loss.

2. **Equality Comparison (`b == a`)**
Despite `b` losing precision, `b == a` evaluates to `true` because `a` exceeds the precision range of `double`. Both `a` and `b` effectively represent the same `double` value.

3. **Casting Back to `long` and Comparison**
Casting `b` back to `long` truncates the decimal part, yielding `18014398509481984`, which is less than the original `a`. Hence, `(long) b < a` returns `true`.

== Puzzle 2: Large `double` to `long` Conversion

Examine the following code:

[source,java]
----
double c = 1e19;
long d = 0;
d += c;
System.out.println("\nd < c is " + (d < c));
System.out.println("d < (long) c is " + (d < (long) c));
----

Produces:

[source]
----
d < c is true
d < (long) c is false
----

=== Analysis

This puzzle demonstrates the intricacies of type conversion and arithmetic operations in Java.

1. **Initial Assignment**
`c` is assigned `1e19`, a value that exceeds the maximum value a `long` can hold (`Long.MAX_VALUE` is approximately `9.22e18`). Adding `c` to `d` results in `d` becoming `Infinity` due to overflow.

2. **Comparisons**
- `d < c`: Since `d` is now `Infinity`, and `c` is `1e19`, the comparison `Infinity < 1e19` is `false`.
- `d < (long) c`: Casting `c` to `long` results in overflow, yielding `Long.MIN_VALUE`. Thus, `Infinity < Long.MIN_VALUE` is `false`.

== Puzzle 3: `Double` Object Comparisons

Consider the following code:

[source,java]
----
Double e = 0.0;
Double f = 0.0;
System.out.println("\ne <= f is " + (e <= f));
System.out.println("e >= f is " + (e >= f));
System.out.println("e == f is " + (e == f));
----

Produces:

[source]
----
e <= f is true
e >= f is true
e == f is false
----

=== Analysis

This puzzle explores the behaviour of object comparisons in Java.

1. **Comparison Operators (`&lt;=` and `>=`)**
These operators compare the primitive `double` values of `e` and `f`, both `0.0`, resulting in `true` for both comparisons.

2. **Equality Operator (`==`)**
The `==` operator checks for reference equality. Since `e` and `f` are distinct `Double` objects, `e == f` evaluates to `false` despite representing the same numeric value.

== Puzzle 4: `BigDecimal` Equality and Comparison

Examine the following code:

[source,java]
----
BigDecimal x = new BigDecimal("0.0");
BigDecimal y = BigDecimal.ZERO;
System.out.println("\nx == y is " + (x == y));
System.out.println("x.doubleValue() == y.doubleValue() is " + (x.doubleValue() == y.doubleValue()));
System.out.println("x.equals(y) is " + x.equals(y));
System.out.println("x.compareTo(y) == 0 is " + (x.compareTo(y) == 0));
----

Produces:

[source]
----
x == y is false
x.doubleValue() == y.doubleValue() is true
x.equals(y) is false
x.compareTo(y) == 0 is true
----

=== Analysis

This puzzle delves into the comparison mechanics of the `BigDecimal` class.

1. **Reference Equality (`x == y`)**
`x` and `y` are different objects; hence, `x == y` is `false`.

2. **Primitive Equality (`doubleValue()`)**
Both `x` and `y` convert to the same primitive `double` value `0.0`, making `x.doubleValue() == y.doubleValue()` `true`.

3. **`equals` Method**
`BigDecimal.equals()` considers both value and scale. `x` has a scale of `1`, while `y` has a scale of `0`, leading to `x.equals(y)` being `false`.

4. **`compareTo` Method**
`compareTo` only considers the numeric value, ignoring scale differences. Therefore, `x.compareTo(y) == 0` is `true`.

== Bonus Puzzle: The Shrinking Collections

This bonus puzzle involves a collection of `BigDecimal` values. Take a look at the following code:

[source,java]
----
List<BigDecimal> bds = Arrays.asList(
    new BigDecimal("1"),
    new BigDecimal("1.0"),
    new BigDecimal("1.00"),
    BigDecimal.ONE
);
System.out.println("bds.size()=    " + bds.size());

Set<BigDecimal> bdSet = new HashSet<>(bds);
System.out.println("bdSet.size()=  " + bdSet.size());

Set<BigDecimal> bdSet2 = new TreeSet<>(bds);
System.out.println("bdSet2.size()= " + bdSet2.size());
----

=== Output

[source]
----
bds.size()=    4
bdSet.size()=  3
bdSet2.size()= 1
----

== Explanation

At first glance, it might seem surprising that the sizes of the collections are shrinking. Here's why this happens:

=== 1. `bds.size()= 4`

The `bds` list contains four distinct `BigDecimal` objects, so `bds.size()` returns 4. However, we need to understand why the set sizes shrink.

=== 2. `bdSet.size()= 3`

A `HashSet` in Java removes duplicates based on the `equals()` method. In this case, `BigDecimal` uses the `equals()` method to check for equality. The values `new BigDecimal("1")`, `new BigDecimal("1.0")`, and `new BigDecimal("1.00")` are considered equal because they all represent the same numeric value: 1.0. So, the `HashSet` eliminates two of the four entries, leaving only three elements in the set.

=== 3. `bdSet2.size()= 1`

A `TreeSet` uses the `compareTo()` method to determine uniqueness and respects objects' natural ordering. In this case, `BigDecimal` compares the values numerically, so all the `BigDecimal` objects in the list are considered equal because they all represent the value 1.0. Therefore, only one element is retained in the `TreeSet`, and the size is 1.

== Key Takeaways

* Converting between `long` and `double` can lead to precision loss, affecting equality and comparison operations.
* Operators like `==` behave differently for object references versus primitive values.
* The `equals()` method considers scale, while `compareTo()` does not, impacting how `BigDecimal` instances are treated in collections.
* Different `Set` implementations (`HashSet` vs. `TreeSet`) handle object uniqueness based on their respective equality mechanisms.

By understanding the behaviour of the `HashSet` and `TreeSet` with respect to the `BigDecimal` class, you can better predict the results of such operations in your code.

== Conclusion

In Java, the choice of collection can lead to surprising results when working with classes with custom equality and comparison behaviour. In this puzzle, the `BigDecimal` class reveals its nuances when used with `HashSet` and `TreeSet`, leading to shrinking collection sizes.
