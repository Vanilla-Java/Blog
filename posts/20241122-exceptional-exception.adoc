= Exceptional Exception, StackTrace extends Throwable
Peter Lawrey, CEO of Chronicle Software

== Exploring Surprising Properties of Extending `Throwable` in Java

In Java, most developers are familiar with extending `Exception` or `Error` to create custom exceptions.
However, directly extending `Throwable` can lead to surprising and potentially useful behaviors.
In this article, we'll delve into the nuances of extending `Throwable` and explore practical applications that can enhance debugging and monitoring in Java applications.
The example code is available at https://github.com/Vanilla-Java/Blog/tree/main/core-concepts/src/main/java/blog/vanillajava/throwable[here].

== Extending `Throwable`

At first glance, extending `Throwable` might seem unusual.
Unlike `Exception`, which is checked, or `Error`, which is unchecked, `Throwable` itself can be extended to create a new checked throwable that is neither an exception nor an error.

[source,java]
----
public class MyThrowable extends Throwable {
}

public static void main(String... args) throws MyThrowable {
    throw new MyThrowable(); // Must be declared or caught
}
----

In this example, `MyThrowable` is a checked throwable, and the compiler enforces that it must be declared in the `throws` clause or caught, even though it doesn't extend `Exception`.

== Practical Uses of Extending `Throwable`

While these behaviors are interesting, you might wonder about practical applications.
One such use is creating a custom `StackTrace` class that extends `Throwable` but is not intended to be thrown or caught.
This can be incredibly useful for debugging and monitoring purposes.

=== Creating a Custom `StackTrace` Class

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Throwable created purely to report a stack trace.
 * This is not an Error or an Exception and is not expected to be thrown or caught.
 */
public class StackTrace extends Throwable {
    public StackTrace() {
        this("Stack trace");
    }

    public StackTrace(String message) {
        this(message, null);
    }

    public StackTrace(String message, Throwable cause) {
        super(message + " on " + Thread.currentThread().getName(), cause);
    }
}
----

Some important points to consider:
* This class is not meant to be thrown.
Since it extends `Throwable` directly, it's checked by the compiler.
* The stack trace is captured when the `Throwable` is created, not when it's thrown.
* The actual `StackTraceElement` objects are created lazily, reducing overhead until they're needed.

=== Recording Where a Resource Was Closed

One practical application is recording where a resource was closed, especially when dealing with concurrency or complex resource management.

[source,java]
----
package blog.vanillajava.throwable;

import net.openhft.chronicle.core.StackTrace;
import java.io.Closeable;

/**
 * A class that simulates a closeable resource and throws an exception if the resource is used after it has been closed.
 */
public abstract class TracingCloseable implements Closeable {
    private transient StackTrace closedHere;
    private volatile boolean isClosed = false;

    /**
     * Closes the resource and records the stack trace where it was closed.
     */
    @Override
    public void close() {
        if (isClosed) return;
        closedHere = new StackTrace("Resource closed here");
        isClosed = true;
    }

    /**
     * Simulates the usage of the resource. Throws an exception if the resource has already been closed.
     */
    protected void throwIfClosed() {
        if (isClosed) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Attempted to use a closed resource.", closedHere);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Simulates the usage of the resource. Throws an exception if the resource has already been closed.
     */
    public void use() {
        throwIfClosed();
        // do something with the resource
    }

    /**
     * Main method to demonstrate the usage of the MyCloseable class.
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        TracingCloseable resource = new TracingCloseable() {};

        // Start a thread to close the resource
        Thread closer = new Thread(() -> {
            resource.close(); // line 51
        }, "CloserThread");
        closer.start();
        closer.join();

        resource.use(); // Throws exception with stack trace as it's already closed
    }
}
----

If you attempt to use the resource after it has been closed, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown, including the name of the thread that closed the resource and a stack trace of where the resource was closed:

[source]
----
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Attempted to use a closed resource.
	at blog.vanillajava.throwable.TracingCloseable.throwIfClosed(TracingCloseable.java:31)
	at blog.vanillajava.throwable.TracingCloseable.use(TracingCloseable.java:39)
	at blog.vanillajava.throwable.TracingCloseable.main(TracingCloseable.java:56)
Caused by: net.openhft.chronicle.core.StackTrace: Resource closed here on CloserThread
	at blog.vanillajava.throwable.TracingCloseable.close(TracingCloseable.java:22)
	at blog.vanillajava.throwable.TracingCloseable.lambda$main$0(TracingCloseable.java:51)
----

You can see that this resource was previously closed on line `TracingCloseable.java:51`, in the "CloserThread" thread.
This information is invaluable when debugging resource management issues, especially in multi-threaded environments.

=== Monitoring Critical Threads in Production

In production environments, profiling can be intrusive.
However, you might still need to monitor critical threads for performance issues.
By capturing stack traces when a thread's execution exceeds a certain threshold, you can identify bottlenecks without significant overhead.

=== Detecting Concurrent Access to Single-Threaded Resources

Some resources are designed to be accessed by a single thread.
If accessed concurrently, it can lead to undefined behaviour.
By tracking the thread that first used the resource, you can detect and prevent concurrent access.

 * A class that ensures a resource is accessed by only one thread when assertions are enabled.
 * If the resource is accessed by multiple threads, an exception is thrown with a stack trace
 * showing where the resource was first accessed.
 *
 * Note: This class relies on Java assertions for checking. Ensure assertions
 * are enabled using the `-ea` JVM option. If assertions are disabled, the resource
 * will not enforce single-threaded access.
 */
public class SingleThreadedResource {
    private volatile StackTrace firstUsageStackTrace;
    private Thread owningThread;

    /**
     * Uses the resource. Ensures that the resource is accessed
     * only by the thread that first used it.
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the resource is accessed by a different thread
     *                                after being used by another thread.
     */
    public void use() {
        assert verifySingleThreadedAccess();
        // Add resource usage logic here
    }

    /**
     * Checks that the resource is accessed by only one thread. Records the initial thread
     * and its stack trace on the first access. If accessed by a different thread,
     * throws an exception with details of the initial access.
     *
     * @return true if the resource is accessed by the owning thread or this is the first access.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the resource is accessed by multiple threads.

        Thread currentThread = Thread.currentThread();
        if (owningThread == null) {
            // Record the first thread that uses this resource
            owningThread = currentThread;
            firstUsageStackTrace = new StackTrace("Resource first accessed here");
        } else if (owningThread != currentThread) {
            // Throw an exception if accessed by a different thread
            throw new IllegalStateException(
                String.format("Resource accessed by multiple threads: '%s' (first) and '%s' (current).",
                              owningThread.getName(), currentThread.getName()),

=== Disabling Stack Trace Collection

While collecting stack traces is useful, it can introduce overhead.
You can conditionally disable stack trace creation using a control flag or system property:

[source,java]
----
if (Jvm.isResourceTracing()) {
    createdHere = new StackTrace(getClass().getName() + " created here");
} else {
    createdHere = null;
}
// OR if using assertions
assert (createdHere = new StackTrace(getClass().getName() + " created here")) != null;
