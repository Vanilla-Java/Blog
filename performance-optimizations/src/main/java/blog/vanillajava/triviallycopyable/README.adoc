# How To Get C++ Speed in Java Serialization
Using Trivially Copyable Objects To Improve Java Serialisation Speeds
---------------------------------------------------------------------

For any low-latency software, it is vital that the most common operations introduce minimal latency. For example, in trading software, one common and time-sensitive operation is messaging between microservices. To minimize the memory footprint of the communication, all messages are serialized by the sender and deserialized by the receiver. Hence, from a performance perspective, it is vital that the process of serializing/deserializing introduces minimal latency.

Read this article and learn more about the low-latency technique leveraging C++ methodology in Java: Trivially Copyable Objects and `memcpy`. Make common operations a little faster thereby saving a lot of time in aggregate operation. Serialization of Trivially Copyable Objects can be more than five times faster than that of regular Java objects and is supported by Chronicle libraries such as [Chronicle Services](https://chronicle.software/products/services/) and other libraries as described in this [related article](https://dzone.com/articles/did-you-know-the-fastest-way-of-serializing-a-java) on DZone.

### Trivially Copyable Objects – in Java?

Trivially Copyable Objects are common in C++ development, but if you are unfamiliar with the term, an analogy may help demonstrate their advantages.

Imagine you work at a warehouse, where you regularly get a last-minute order of two foos and one bar that is due for shipping. The foos are located in the west end of the warehouse, the bars in the east, so you need to visit both ends of the warehouse to collect the order. That takes time. What if, for this common last-minute order, you could instead keep the components in one place? Then, whenever you get the time-critical order you could quickly collect them and send them off.

Keeping the components in one place is, roughly, the concept of Trivially Copyable Objects, for which all information is stored in one contiguous memory block. With all data in one place, it is possible to copy the data from that memory location to another in a single operation. In C++ this can be achieved using `memcpy` which is the fastest way to copy data.

Regular Java objects contain references to objects or non-primitive data types, which are stored in different memory locations. To copy such a Java object entails multiple memory copies, analogous to running around in the warehouse. Copying Java objects is thus expensive in terms of latency.

Fortunately, we can leverage the mentioned C++ scheme and make Java serialization much faster. The key is to create Trivially Copyable Java Objects, that is, objects so simple that they can be copied in a single operation. The requirements? Use only primitive data fields. Since primitive fields have a fixed size, the size of a Trivially Copyable Object is static and the object can thus be stored in a single memory block. It may seem limiting to only use primitive data types, but even objects with non-primitive fields can often be converted to Trivially Copyable Objects.

### Chronicle Serialization Benchmarks

Chronicle serialization libraries offer full support for Trivially Copyable Objects in Java, enabling much faster data serialization.

In the benchmarks shown below, two microservice applications are used, with one sending BookUpdates to the other via a persisted queue. The `BookUpdate` class is either a “Normal Object” with a symbol, exchange, time as `String` objects and a `List` of asks and bids OR it is a “Trivially Copyable Object” with these fields mapped to primitive fields like `int`_,_ `long` or `double` fields.

As can be seen below, serialization and deserialization of a Trivially Copyable Object is more than 5 times faster than that of a regular object in the typical case (50% percentile). All times are in microseconds.

#### Normal Objects

The higher percentiles show less difference between the two variants likely related to other things than serialization, such as SSD device latency.

### What Are the Drawbacks of This Approach?

While using `memcpy` is efficient, the Java standard leaves it open to JVM implementers how objects are laid out in memory. This means that there is no guarantee that objects sent using one type of JVM (e.g. OpenJDK) can be properly received using another type of JVM (e.g., J9). However, for any given JVM type, the memory layout is known to have been stable over time so if the same family of JVMs is used across the board, there should be no problems. It is very easy to add integration tests, ensuring full compatibility.

Conclusion
----------

It is possible to significantly improve the latency footprint of serialization and deserialization by applying the principle of Trivially Copyable Objects in Java development. The key principle for such objects is that they contain only primitive data fields, and the good news is that even objects of non-primitive data fields can often be converted to trivially copyable ones.

== Fastest Way of Serializing Java Field

Learn how to apply C++'s trivially copyable scheme in Java and get blazing serialization speed using Unsafe and memcpy to directly copy the fields in one single sweep to memory or to a memory-mapped file.

In a previous article about link:https://chronicle.software/open-hft/queue/[open-source Chronicle Queue], there was some benchmarking and method profiling indicating that the speed of serialization had a significant impact on execution performance. After all, this is only to be expected as Chronicle Queue (and other persisted queue libraries) must convert Java objects located on the heap to binary data which is subsequently stored in files. Even for the most internally efficient libraries, this inevitable serialization procedure will largely dictate performance.

== Data Transfer Object

In this article, we will use a Data Transfer Object (hereafter DTO) named `MarketData` which contains financial information with a relatively large number of fields. The same principles apply to other DTOs in any other business area.

[source,java]
----
abstract class MarketData extends SelfDescribingMarshallable {

    long securityId;
    long time;

    // bid and ask quantities
    double bidQty0, bidQty1, bidQty2, bidQty3;
    double askQty0, askQty1, askQty2, askQty3;

    // bid and ask prices
    double bidPrice0, bidPrice1, bidPrice2, bidPrice3;
    double askPrice0, askPrice1, askPrice2, askPrice3;

    // Getters and setters not shown for clarity

}
----

== Default Serialization

Java’s `Serializable` marker interface provides a default way to serialize Java objects to/from the binary format, usually via the `ObjectOutputStream` and `ObjectInputStream` classes. The default way (whereby the magic `writeObject()` and `readObject()` are not explicitly declared) entails reflecting over an object's non-transient fields and reading/writing them one by one, which can be a relatively costly operation.

Chronicle Queue can work with `Serializable` objects but also provides a similar, but faster and more space-efficient way to serialize data via the abstract class `SelfDescribingMarshallable`. Akin to Serializable objects, this relies on reflection but comes with substantially less overhead in terms of payload, CPU cycles, and garbage.

Default serialization often comprises the steps of:

* Identifying the non-transient fields using reflection
* Reading/writing the identified non-transient field values using reflection
* Writing/reading the field values to a target format (e.g., binary format)

The identification of non-transient fields can be cached, eliminating this step to improve performance.

[source,java]
----
public final class DefaultMarketData extends MarketData {}
----

== Explicit Serialization

Classes implementing `Serializable` can elect to implement two magic private (sic!) methods whereby these methods will be invoked instead of resorting to default serialization.

This provides full control of the serialization process and allows fields to be read using custom code rather than via reflection which will improve performance. A drawback with this method is that if a field is added to the class, then the corresponding logic must be added in the two magic methods above or else the new field will not participate in serialization. Another problem is that private methods are invoked by external classes. This is a fundamental violation of encapsulation.

`SelfDescribingMarshallable` classes work in a similar fashion but thankfully do not rely on magic methods and invoking private methods externally. A `SelfDescribingMarshallable` class provides two fundamentally different concepts of serializing: one via an intermediary link:https://chronicle.software/open-hft/wire/[Chronicle Wire] (e.g., binary, text, YAML, JSON) providing flexibility, and one implicitly binary providing high performance.

[source,java]

public final class ExplicitMarketData extends MarketData {

    @Override
    public void readMarshallable(BytesIn bytes) {
        securityId = bytes.readLong();
        time = bytes.readLong();
        bidQty0 = bytes.readDouble();
        bidQty1 = bytes.readDouble();
        bidQty2 = bytes.readDouble();
        bidQty3 = bytes.readDouble();
        askQty0 = bytes.readDouble();
        askQty1 = bytes.readDouble();
        askQty2 = bytes.readDouble();
        askQty3 = bytes.readDouble();
        bidPrice0 = bytes.readDouble();
        bidPrice1 = bytes.readDouble();
        bidPrice2 = bytes.readDouble();
        bidPrice3 = bytes.readDouble();
        askPrice0 = bytes.readDouble();
        askPrice1 = bytes.readDouble();
        askPrice2 = bytes.readDouble();
        askPrice3 = bytes.readDouble();
    }

    @Override
    public void writeMarshallable(BytesOut bytes) {
        bytes.writeLong(securityId);
        bytes.writeLong(time);
        bytes.writeDouble(bidQty0);
        bytes.writeDouble(bidQty1);
        bytes.writeDouble(bidQty2);
        bytes.writeDouble(bidQty3);
        bytes.writeDouble(askQty0);
        bytes.writeDouble(askQty1);
        bytes.writeDouble(askQty2);
        bytes.writeDouble(askQty3);
        bytes.writeDouble(bidPrice0);
        bytes.writeDouble(bidPrice1);
        bytes.writeDouble(bidPrice2);
        bytes.writeDouble(bidPrice3);
        bytes.writeDouble(askPrice0);
        bytes.writeDouble(askPrice1);
        bytes.writeDouble(askPrice2);
        bytes.writeDouble(askPrice3);
    }

== Trivially Copyable Serialization

The concept of Trivially Copyable Java Objects is derived from and inspired by C++.

[source,java]
----
import static net.openhft.chronicle.bytes.BytesUtil.*;

public final class TriviallyCopyableMarketData extends MarketData {

    static final int START =
            triviallyCopyableStart(TriviallyCopyableMarketData.class);

    static final int LENGTH =
            triviallyCopyableLength(TriviallyCopyableMarketData.class);

    @Override
    public void readMarshallable(BytesIn bytes) {
        bytes.unsafeReadObject(this, START, LENGTH);
    }

    @Override
    public void writeMarshallable(BytesOut bytes) {
        bytes.unsafeWriteObject(this, START, LENGTH);
    }

}

== Why Does It Matter?

Serialization is crucial for externalizing DTOs in persistent queues or data-intensive applications. The performance gains in serialization directly translate to improved latencies and throughput.
