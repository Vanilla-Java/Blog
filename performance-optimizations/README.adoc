== Overview

This project benchmarks different methods for calculating the mid price of two values using different numeric types: `double`, `BigDecimal`, `Decimal64` and `Decimal6f`.
It compares the performance of these methods with different rounding strategies, including rounding to six decimal places.

The benchmarks are implemented using the https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/[Java Microbenchmarking Harness (JMH)].
It tests the speed and accuracy of mid-price calculations on a fixed-size data set.

== Benchmark Methods

The following mid-price calculation methods are compared:

Double Precision (with rounding) ::
Uses primitive `double` types to calculate the mid-price and rounds to 6 decimal places.
Double Precision (without rounding) ::
Uses primitive `double` types to calculate the mid-price without any rounding.
BigDecimal (Divide by 2) ::
Uses the `BigDecimal` class to calculate the mid-price by dividing the sum of two values by 2 and rounding to 6 decimal places.
BigDecimal (Multiply by 0.5) ::
Uses the `BigDecimal` class to calculate the mid-price by multiplying the sum of two values by 0.5 and rounding to 6 decimal places.
BigDecimal (Multiply by 0.5 without rounding) ::
Uses the `BigDecimal` class to calculate the mid-price by multiplying the sum of two values by 0.5 without rounding.
Decimal64 (with rounding) ::
Uses `Decimal64` (from the `deltix` library) to calculate the mid-price and rounds to 6 decimal places.
Decimal6f ::
Uses `Decimal6f` (from the `tools4j` library) to calculate the mid-price with rounding.

== Usage

To run the benchmark, you can execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
java -jar target/benchmarks.jar
----

This will compile and run the benchmark suite, showing results for each of the methods being tested.

== How it Works

The benchmarking class, `MyBenchmark`, initializes three sets of data representing the same values using `double`, `BigDecimal`, and `Decimal64`.
The calculations are done using different mid-price calculation techniques.

The results for each type are stored in separate arrays (`ap`, `bp` for `double`, `ap2`, `bp2` for `BigDecimal`, and `ap3`, `bp3` for `Decimal64`).
After calculating the mid-prices, the values are compared across the different data types to ensure consistency.

== Conclusion

This benchmarking suite provides valuable insights into the performance and accuracy of different numeric types and calculation methods in Java.
The results indicate that `double` and `BigDecimal` are typically faster than `Decimal64` for simple mid-price calculations, but `BigDecimal` may offer more precision and flexibility for financial and high-accuracy computations.
